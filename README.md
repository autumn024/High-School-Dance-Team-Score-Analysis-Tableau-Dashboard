# High School Dance Team Score Analysis Tableau Dashboard

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide an interactive Tableau dashboard for coaches, dancers, and parents. High school dance team scores often come in PDF format, making them difficult to analyze across competitions. This dashboard compiles four years of scores into a single, accessible view. 

## Features
- Filter scores by season and individual competitions.
- Compare competition results across seasons.
- Visualize scoring trends over time.


## Usage
Explore the dashboard on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/DanceTeamDashboard/CoverPage?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Data Source
Scores were collected from official competition PDFs and compiled into structured datasets and cleaned in SQL Server Management for analysis.

## Documentation
For a detailed breakdown of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) steps I followed, see [Dance Team Dashboard SDLC Documentation](https://github.com/autumn024/High-School-Dance-Team-Score-Analysis-Tableau-Dashboard/blob/main/SDLC%20Documentation%20.pdf)

## Future Improvements
- Add mobile-friendly layouts
- Automate score updates
